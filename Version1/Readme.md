Electron On A Stick
-------------------

Standard format prototype board for Particle Photon.

Features:
=========

* Suitable for Core, Photon or Electron.
* Based on V3 of Photon On A Stick
* USB power in via A Connector on left edge or B Connector on Photon. Do not connect both at once.
* Pull-up or down 1206 pads on A0-A7 & B0-B5. Suitable for 1206 or 0805 components.
* Two 1206 in series to GND on D0-D7 & C0-C5. Suitable for 1206 or 0805 components. Use for LED + resistor, Resistor + Capacitor, Resistor + Resistor (or 0R) pull down.
* LED/Resistor/Capacitor 1206 pads Right edge along with 8x2 header for off board connection (8 pins to 1206's and 8 GND. Top 1206 connected to nearest pin, bottom 1206 to 1 in pin.
* 4 1206 pads top/bottom by end of Photon connected to pins to the right of the pad. Ideal of Capacitors, Resistor or LED.
* 3 Mounting holes to allow board to be mounted in case for final use.
